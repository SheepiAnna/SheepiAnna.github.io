<h1>Benefits</h1>

<p>Suono uses advanced sound-reduction technology to ensure that creators have a space suitable for their needs, allowing them to focus on developing their best, most high-quality work. </p>

<h4>1) Affordability and Customer Experience</h4>

<quote> "$9 a panel" </quote> 
<p>Suono also offers a valuable customer experience that goes beyond just sound reduction. With a team committed to ensuring a quality product without breaking the bank, Suono provides a reasonably priced solution, at just $9 a panel. 
</p>
  
<h4>2) Effectiveness and Quality</h4>
<p>The most important benefit, is the effectiveness and quality of our product. To ensure this, we consulted with Professor Wayne Jones before diving into the prototyping phase. We learned that one thick panel is far less effective than a composite panel made up of one piece of material, an air gap, and then a second piece of material. This construction is often referred to as a double leaf effect.
</p>
    


<p>Using this  approach, we were able to engineer a solution using thick stone wool. We made sure to cut each section into different thicknesses, encasing a pocket of air. Because sound waves lose energy when traveling through different densities, we’re sure that this approach is going to decrease the amount of sound passing through the panel. 	</p>   
<p>
    
<h4>3) Strength in Bulk</h4>  
<p>Another benefit of the panels, when used together, is that they reduce the amount of sound reflected as it would bounce off of one another. To encourage this, we sell our panels in packs of 10 at a discounted rate!
</p>

<h4>3) Style</h4>  
<p>The final plus of Suono, and personally my favorite, is the style! Almost all soundproofing solutions on the market today are boring, monochrome, and honestly just ugly. Suono hopes to change this by offering a variety of stylish designs. Our customers are creatives, and we want to encourage this! Our goal is that they appreciate all aspects of the product, not just it’s functionality and affordability.</p>
